# Flood Prediction Project 

This project predicts flood risk using **Machine Learning** techniques and weather data.  
Built and trained on Google Colab.

* Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning model training
- Flood risk prediction based on weather parameters

* How to Run
1. Open `flood_prediction_.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells to preprocess data and train the model.
3. Test with custom inputs for flood prediction.

* Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
